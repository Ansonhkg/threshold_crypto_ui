## Running tests

Open the tool in the browser.

Open tests.js in text editor.

Copy and paste all test code into console of dev tools in browser.

When tests are complete it will show "All tests passed" in the console.

If a test fails it will throw an error shown in the console.

One day a framework will arrive, probably selenium, but not for now
to keep dependencies to a minimum.
